# CTES
A compile-time approach to automatically classify the security bugs

# How To Compile
If you want to compile our CTES, you must ensure that your system has installed the llvm-3.5.0 and clang-3.5.0.

We offer a makefile for you to compile CTES.

# How To Evaluate
The 14 real-world programs are avaliable in the real-world programs folder, and we have placed the myproject excutable file in ecah real-world prgram folder.

In the home folder, we offer you two excutable files to evaluate CTES on efficiency.
myproject1 will transform the source code into AST, myproject2 is our CTES for bug detection.

We offer you an example of micro-benchmark of bad and good version. See them in the folder
micro-benchmark.
